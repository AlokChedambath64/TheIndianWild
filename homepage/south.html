                Kabini forest reserve is one of the best wildlife destination in Karnataka mainly because of its accessibility, rich green vegetation, water body and possibility of the animal spotting like herds of Elephants, Jaguar, Tiger and Black Leopard.
                An eighty km drive from Mysore or 205 kms drive from Bengaluru makes the accessibility much more easier for people from Karanataka and people from Kerala can reach through Wayanad  the origin land of Kabini River.
                The connection of south-eastern part of Nagarahole National Park gives more chances for animal spotting during summer. On the banks of Kabini Reservoir we could find 55 acres of forest land, steep valleys and other water bodies.
                In ancient period Kabini was the hunting spot for Mysore Maharaja, British viceroys and Indian Royalties.
                Kabini is surrounded by Nagarhole wildlife sanctuary and connected to several other lands like Tholpetty Wildlife Sanctuary, Kuruva Island, Sagar Dam and Wayanad.
